        <main class = "col col-1"><h2>What is right for me?</h2><h3>by Simon May</h3>As a student of Computer Games Development, I did not when I applied realise the variation of the work that the course would entail, from the coding languages learnt to the potential job aspects after we have finished is extremely varied. The first option which would be at the forefront of the job pile would obviously be a programmer for a games company, throughout the job market the most looked for skill in coding would be C# and use of unity. Throughout most of the jobs that you find, you will notice that this is the main requirement, as stated on <a href = "https://www.payscale.com/research/UK/Job=Video_Game_Programmer/Salary/8a0f65ed/Entry-Level">PayScale</a>
            The average wage for an entry level games programmer "is roughly about  £28,000 which is a great starting point for when you leave university but this is a small market to get into which you need to bare in mind. If you’re local to Northampton you’re in a great spot for some great studios, being in a central location and a lot of game studios in Leamington Spa, which is a short 45 minute drive from the town and with train connections straight to London and Birmingham very regularly. When it comes to web development although the average pay is slightly less at £24,000, there are a lot more opportunities to take a job as there are more companies throughout the UK. <a href = "https://www.indeed.co.uk/viewjob?jk=40fde05fe19a9d57&tk=1cvgdgid817de000&from=company">Indeed Job for Games Development</a>
            If you were to look at the web development side of the course, there are a few fundamental codes you need to understand which are HTML5, CSS and JavaScript. These three combined with any other coding languages will put you leagues above other candidates looking. And some jobs specifically are aimed at entry level, so no previous experience in the industry is required. When it comes to the work though you will be creating front end packages for companies which will need to be modern and responsive as there are many different platforms the web can be viewed on. <blockquote>The web is now a staple of modern day society so this will be a job which is needed for many years to come and will be always changing to keep up with the technology of today.</blockquote>

                <main class= "col col-2"> There are many transferable skills that we can take as students into whichever pathway we chose, the need for debugging being used in web, software development, games techniques and any other IT based role. One of the biggest skills you will need to use is the ability to work as a part of a team, and people skills. Being able to communicate and make sure that your code be it C# or CSS needs to be able to be read by your team and should they need to change it be able to without taking the changes personally. With games programming you could be programming for one specific platform, which means everything is just done for one machine, when doing web however you need to make sure that they are compatible for phones, tablets, tvs, pc and however else the website can be viewed which means keeping the code up to date with new software and conventions, where as once a game has been made you are free to move on unless the game required any updates, but this may still only be on one specific platform. There is the chance they can be multi platform and coded differently so would be completely separate as they would use different languages and engines to run.
                    So each of the jobs have their upsides and downsides so it down to you to make sure that you do what you enjoy the most. <img src = "game1.png">
